## Project Reflection

This project was built during second semester of my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.

The main goal was to create password validation web application with vanilla JavaScript functions and utilities. 

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
